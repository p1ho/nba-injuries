# NBA Injuries

- This is the repository that receives the push from [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/p1ho/nba-injury-scraper) by building [NBA Injury Scraper](https://github.com/p1ho/nba-injury-scraper).

- I do not claim ownership for any data here, only the effort of reprocessing webpage data collected from scraping publicly available data from [Fox Sports](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/teams).

- This should be useful for anyone attempting to build data visualization for a complete list of player injuries, since no free API currently exists for this information. ([Fantasy-Basketball-Nerd API](https://www.fantasybasketballnerd.com/service/injuries/) only offers report for current injuries)
